Money sent out using LRS now has a Tax Collection at Source (TCS) of 20% with no upper or lower threshold, compared to 5% over Rs 7lks earlier.
TCS can be claimed after filing income tax returns at the end of the year, but it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that many will be okay with having 20% of capital blocked until then.</description></item></channel></rss>
