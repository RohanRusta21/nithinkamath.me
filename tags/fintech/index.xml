This often leads to wrong estimates of trading activity and market size &amp;amp; share. So if A buys stock X for Rs 1lk &amp;amp; B sells for Rs 1lk, the exchange turnover = Rs 1lk &amp;amp; not Rs 2lks.

Maybe 15 crores max! Here&amp;rsquo;s why, with Fintech as a reference, since some data is available. I guess it is important to know this, so we can all be rationally optimistic.
I get puzzled whenever someone says India has 140cr people &amp;amp; only 9cr demat accounts (6% of the population), &amp;amp; this can grow to 40 crores (25% as in developed nations) over the next few years.</description></item></channel></rss>
