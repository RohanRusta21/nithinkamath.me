Otherwise, the chances of you being irrational, taking large bets, overtrading &amp;amp; blowing up are high. And to nudge you to do just that, we now have a “Kill Switch”.
Enabling the Kill switch will instantly disable trading. Currently, this is manual. But we are working on automating this where you can set a maximum loss.</description></item><item><title>Introducing tags and trading journal on Console</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-tags-on-console/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-tags-on-console/</guid><description>We are stoked about the new tagging feature on Console. Tagging your trades and maintaining a trading journal can help you become a better trader and also help you track your investment goals.
You can&amp;rsquo;t become a better trader if you don&amp;rsquo;t learn from your mistakes. But in order to learn, you need a proper journal of all your trades and the reasons you took the trades. You can then look back, review, and do more of what is working &amp;amp; less of what isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>On the noise about our salaries</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-the-noise-about-our-salaries/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-the-noise-about-our-salaries/</guid><description>I’m surprised by the unwanted noise around this whole salary news of Nikhil, Seema (my wife), &amp;amp; me. The headlines are misleading. We are a private company &amp;amp; no obligations to clarify, but we thought maybe we should, as there are folks who are misinterpreting this.
Firstly the reported figure isn’t the actual salary being drawn. This is an enabling resolution that allows us as working promoters to draw salaries up to the number in case of liquidity requirements.</description></item><item><title>A few thoughts on the Zerodha journey so far</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-the-zerodha-journey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-the-zerodha-journey/</guid><description>Last 2 years have been spectacular for Zerodha . Lucky to be at right place right time, ready with products &amp;amp; initiatives when there was a surge in retail participation. With success, what I say gets valued more Grimacing faceHere are a few questions that we get asked frequently.
Why haven’t we raised any external capital, especially at times like these when we could get some crazy valuation? I had talked about it earlier</description></item><item><title>Worklife balance at Zerodha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/worklife-balance-at-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/worklife-balance-at-zerodha/</guid><description>At Zerodha, we have just killed all work-related chats post 6 pm &amp;amp; holidays. Also trying to get as many conversations to be asynchronous, moving them from chat to our internal instance of Discourse. Curious to see if this helps reduce the feeling of burnt out &amp;amp; brain fried. Apparently, multitasking hurts performance and may even damage the brain (check the link below). Being part of multiple discussions on different topics in different chat groups simultaneously (Multitasking) has gone up exponentially post WFH.</description></item><item><title>Why FOSS?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-foss/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-foss/</guid><description>Every time we share a post on the Zerodha tech blog, we get a lot of love from the tech community, but also questions like - Why FOSS? Why be so transparent? No security concerns sharing all this info? So yeah, answers from the man behind the scene - Dr. K
Why Free &amp;amp; Open source software?
Superior utility: Pretty much everything in the known universe uses FOSS, from the Mars rovers to our phones to washing machines.</description></item><item><title>Why doesn't Zerodha advertise?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-doesnt-zerodha-advertise/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-doesnt-zerodha-advertise/</guid><description>One thing I get asked the most and I’ve tweeted about this numerous times is that why don’t we advertise. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d shared this sometime back.
Unlike buying a mobile phone or ordering a pizza, you don&amp;rsquo;t invest in stocks &amp;amp; MFs impulsively. Most often than not, we invest because of greed or because of our friends. And regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to advertise greed.
Ads do help you create visibility and build credibility - two really important things in the business of money, especially the first few years.</description></item><item><title>Podcast with Prateek Singh, the founder of LearnApp</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</guid><description>From the start at Zerodha, we&amp;rsquo;ve constantly shared things to educate people about the capital markets. Zerodha Varsity was our first formal attempt in text. But we knew that video was also important, &amp;amp; that people trust content delivered by experts.
This was the reason behind partnering with LearnApp through Rainmatter. The amazing bit in the journey has been that some of the best folks in our industry have been incredibly generous with their time to share their knowledge with no expectations.</description></item><item><title>Risks of running a brokerage firm</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/risks-of-running-a-brokerage-firm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/risks-of-running-a-brokerage-firm/</guid><description>The big news from last week was the blow-up of a leveraged hedge fund Archegos &amp;amp; how it caused $billions in losses to its bank/broker. A primer to what it means to be a brokerage for such trades, the risk to reward, and more.
Being a broker is almost like running an insurance business, you keep earning brokerage income (like premium) &amp;amp; are always one black swan or mega volatile day away from giving it all back and more if one large client or many small clients default at the same time.</description></item><item><title>Market size estimates</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/maket-size-estimates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/maket-size-estimates/</guid><description>Market size estimate (Revenue), from the two reports that I just read.

Almost unreal that we could represent Zerodha on the cover of Forbes. Some personal lessons from the many highs &amp;amp; many lows in this 20-year journey working, trading, trying to build different types of businesses, &amp;amp; more.
Businesses can be built in multiple ways. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to cut-copy-paste what others are doing - it mostly won’t work. Do what feels right to you. Your instincts on what is right will work better when you build a business/career around what you love.</description></item></channel></rss>
