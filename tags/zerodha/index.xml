Coincidentally it&amp;rsquo;s Zerodha&amp;rsquo;s 11th birthday today too.üòÄ If I were to look back, we are most proud of building a business that continues to innovate, &amp;amp; prioritise customer interest over business growth constantly.

Historically, market crashes caused panic &amp;amp; reduced activity. But this crisis led to a rush of new customers looking to buy into stocks on sale. Free time due to lockdowns &amp;amp; low bank deposit rates helped.
Once this younger bunch of first-time investors saw quick profits, they started spreading the word and got their friends &amp;amp; family to invest.</description></item><item><title>Why look at notional contract value when buying options?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-look-at-notional-contract-value/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-look-at-notional-contract-value/</guid><description>Why look at notional contract value when buying options?
Yes, when you buy options the max you can lose is the premium you have paid. But to get a sense of risk and how fast or easily you can lose, you should look at the exposure or contract value, not the premium.
For eg, you have Rs 1L &amp;amp; you use it to buy 20 lots of Nifty calls = Rs 1.</description></item><item><title>Option buying - The riskiest trade</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/options-buying-the-riskiest-trade/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/options-buying-the-riskiest-trade/</guid><description>~80% of all open buy option positions at the end of every day are in losses.
Buying options ruins most retail traders. Because they don&amp;rsquo;t understand the risk of leverage, averaging down, &amp;amp; impact costs.

If you add impact costs, the minimum return an active trader should generate to break even yearly on their portfolio is usually well above 20%. Yep, that high and that tough.
Costs include Statutory costs like STT, Stamp duty, GST Impact costs or slippages (while this doesn‚Äôt even seem like a cost, it adds up quickly.</description></item><item><title>Introducing kill switch</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-kill-switch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-kill-switch/</guid><description>When you&amp;rsquo;re in a drawdown while trading, the best thing to do is to take a break. Otherwise, the chances of you being irrational, taking large bets, overtrading &amp;amp; blowing up are high. And to nudge you to do just that, we now have a ‚ÄúKill Switch‚Äù.
Enabling the Kill switch will instantly disable trading. Currently, this is manual. But we are working on automating this where you can set a maximum loss.</description></item><item><title>Introducing tags and trading journal on Console</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-tags-on-console/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-tags-on-console/</guid><description>We are stoked about the new tagging feature on Console. Tagging your trades and maintaining a trading journal can help you become a better trader and also help you track your investment goals.
You can&amp;rsquo;t become a better trader if you don&amp;rsquo;t learn from your mistakes. But in order to learn, you need a proper journal of all your trades and the reasons you took the trades. You can then look back, review, and do more of what is working &amp;amp; less of what isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>On the noise about our salaries</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-the-noise-about-our-salaries/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-the-noise-about-our-salaries/</guid><description>I‚Äôm surprised by the unwanted noise around this whole salary news of Nikhil, Seema (my wife), &amp;amp; me.

Firstly the reported figure isn‚Äôt the actual salary being drawn.

Also trying to get as many conversations to be asynchronous, moving them from chat to our internal instance of Discourse. Curious to see if this helps reduce the feeling of burnt out &amp;amp; brain fried. Apparently, multitasking hurts performance and may even damage the brain (check the link below). Being part of multiple discussions on different topics in different chat groups simultaneously (Multitasking) has gone up exponentially post WFH.</description></item><item><title>Why FOSS?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-foss/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-foss/</guid><description>Every time we share a post on the Zerodha tech blog, we get a lot of love from the tech community, but also questions like - Why FOSS?

Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d shared this sometime back.
Unlike buying a mobile phone or ordering a pizza, you don&amp;rsquo;t invest in stocks &amp;amp; MFs impulsively. Most often than not, we invest because of greed or because of our friends. And regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to advertise greed.
Ads do help you create visibility and build credibility - two really important things in the business of money, especially the first few years.</description></item><item><title>Podcast with Prateek Singh, the founder of LearnApp</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</guid><description>From the start at Zerodha, we&amp;rsquo;ve constantly shared things to educate people about the capital markets.

A primer to what it means to be a brokerage for such trades, the risk to reward, and more.
Being a broker is almost like running an insurance business, you keep earning brokerage income (like premium) &amp;amp; are always one black swan or mega volatile day away from giving it all back and more if one large client or many small clients default at the same time.</description></item><item><title>Market size estimates</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/maket-size-estimates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/maket-size-estimates/</guid><description>Market size estimate (Revenue), from the two reports that I just read.

Almost unreal that we could represent Zerodha on the cover of Forbes. Some personal lessons from the many highs &amp;amp; many lows in this 20-year journey working, trading, trying to build different types of businesses, &amp;amp; more.
Businesses can be built in multiple ways. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to cut-copy-paste what others are doing - it mostly won‚Äôt work. Do what feels right to you. Your instincts on what is right will work better when you build a business/career around what you love.</description></item></channel></rss>
