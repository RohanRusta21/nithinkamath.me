In a world where short term gains trump long term improvements, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to see how the shift to organic — even if good for the planet, would happen if yields are lower.
In May, Sri Lanka banned chemical fertiliser and pesticides &amp;amp; went fully organic. There&amp;rsquo;s been an uproar over this move. Some people and groups have even blamed this move for the food crisis there.</description></item><item><title>Organic farming</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/adoption-of-organic-farming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/adoption-of-organic-farming/</guid><description>I keep asking everyone who’s adopted organic farming if yields drop after they stopped using chemicals.
